Architecture We assume the existence of the following entities:
- Curator (C): C is responsible for creating an encrypted and private database.
C outsources the database to a CSP where it will be stored. Moreover, C
can issue update queries to the CSP update specific entries of the database.
To do so, C keeps locally the latest version of the database.
- Analyst (A): A is an analyst that can perform statistics on the data stored
in the CSP.
- CSP: A cloud service provider that stores an encrypted database. The CSP
releases statistics upon request of the analyst.

        To update the content of a node, C makes use of the homomorphic property of PKE.Enc. More
        precisely, assuming that C wishes to add a value k to the content of a leaf node
        i, she first finds the path from the root of the tree to the leaf i. For every node
        j in the path, C samples a distinct e_j ~ Lap(1/epsilon') and computes k'_j = k_j + e_j . As
        a next step, C encrypts each k'_j using pk_j . Apart from that, C samples a fresh
        noise em for every other node m of the tree and encrypts it using pkm. Finally,
        for each node of the tree, C sends a pair (n, cn) to the CSP. Upon reception, the
        CSP updates each node i using c_i by computing c'_n = c_n_{old} Â· c_n, where c_{nold} the
        current content of the node n.
