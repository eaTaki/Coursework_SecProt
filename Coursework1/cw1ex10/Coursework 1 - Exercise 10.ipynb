    "1. An attacker Eve intercepts the message from Alice to Bob: $A \\rightarrow B: Alice, N_A$.\n",

    "To prevent eavesdropping and impersonation, Alice and Bob can authenticate each other and the server using digital signatures or a mutual authentication protocol. They should include their digital signatures in the messages to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the communication. Additionally, they can use a secure channel, such as a VPN, to protect the confidentiality of their communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Countermeasure for Attack 2:\n",
    "To prevent the server key compromise attack, the server should store its secret key securely, using hardware security modules (HSMs) or other secure storage mechanisms. Regularly updating and rotating keys is also essential. If the server's key is compromised, Alice and Bob should have a mechanism to detect this breach and stop using that key. They can implement key revocation and renewal mechanisms to ensure the security of the protocol."
