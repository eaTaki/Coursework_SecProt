Here's a step-by-step sequence of messages sent among the parties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Public parameters are known to all parties: a large prime number \"p\" and a generator \"g\" of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}^{∗}_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Generation**:\n",
    "   - Each party generates their private key:\n",
    "     - $P_1$: Chooses a random private key $a_1$.\n",
    "     - $P_2$: Chooses a random private key $a_2$.\n",
    "     - $P_3$: Chooses a random private key $a_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each party calculates their public key:\n",
    "     - $A_1 = g^{a_1} \\mod p$\n",
    "     - $A_2 = g^{a_2} \\mod p$\n",
    "     - $A_3 = g^{a_3} \\mod p$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Public Key Exchange**:\n",
    "   - Parties exchange their public keys with one other user:\n",
    "     - $P_1 \\xrightarrow{A_1} P_2$\n",
    "     - $P_2 \\xrightarrow{A_2} P_3$\n",
    "     - $P_3 \\xrightarrow{A_3} P_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Public *\"Secret\"* Calculation**\n",
    "   - Each party generates an intermediate Public/Secret key:\n",
    "     - $A_{31} = A_3^{a_1} \\mod p$\n",

    "\n",
    "   - To ensure key verification, each party shares a cryptographic hash of the calculated shared secrets:\n",
    "       - $P_1 \\xrightarrow{H_1 = H(K_{231})} P_2, P_3$\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Each party verifies the received hash values:\n",
    "     - $P_1$ checks if $H_2$ matches the received hash from $P_2$ and $H_3$ matches the received hash from $P_3$.\n",
    "     - $P_2$ checks if $H_1$ matches the received hash from $P_1$ and $H_3$ matches the received hash from $P_3$.\n",
    "     - $P_3$ checks if $H_1$ matches the received hash from $P_1$ and $H_2$ matches the received hash from $P_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Final Symmetric Key Derivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If all parties successfully verify the received hash values, they can trust that they all share the same secret. \n",
    "\n",
    "And then we should see how the condition:\n",
    "$$ H_1 = H_2 = H_3 $$\n",
